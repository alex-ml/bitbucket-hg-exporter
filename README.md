# bitbucket-hg-exporter

This tool provides a command line interface for exporting all project data from a BitBucket mercurial repository. This includes pull request history, issue trackers, wikis, forks, attachments and commit comments. This data can optionally be migrated to GitHub.

## Current project status
Under active development. Alpha stage.
I currently do not recommend using the tool as it is buggy and incomplete. Please subscribe to [issue #1](https://github.com/philipstarkey/bitbucket-hg-exporter/issues/1) if you want to be notified of when the tool is ready for use.

## What's up with the license?
As Atlassian is refusing to write something like this themselves, I've licensed this work under a custom license that prevents them from using it for their benefit unless they pay me $1million AUD. Obviously this is unlikely to ever happen, but on principle I don't want Atlassian to benefit from my work when it should really have been them writing this tool in the first place.

For everyone else who is not working for the benefit of Atlassian (including individuals, businesses, and enterprises), this tool is free to use and modify under the GPL v3 with the additional restriction that you must retain the clause that prevents Atlassian from benefitting from it or derivative works. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/philipstarkey/bitbucket-hg-exporter/blob/master/LICENSE) file for further details.
