# bitbucket-hg-exporter

This tool provides a command line interface for exporting all project data from a BitBucket mercurial repository. This includes pull request history, issue trackers, wikis, forks, attachments and commit comments. This data can optionally be migrated to GitHub.

## Current project status
Under active development. Alpha stage.
I currently do not recommend using the tool as it is buggy and incomplete. Please subscribe to [issue #1](https://github.com/philipstarkey/bitbucket-hg-exporter/issues/1) if you want to be notified of when the tool is ready for use.

## How can I thank you?
If you are a business or enterprise, and my tool saved you money, please consider donating 10% of the saved money to me to show your thanks. You can donate to me via PayPal [here](https://www.paypal.me/philiptstarkey). I'd also encourage you to donate the remaining 90% to other open source projects you use.

If you are an individual, non-profit, or using this tool for an open source project, then I'd appreciate it if you could "star" my project and share it with other people who would benefit from the tool. You're also welcome to contribute via the PayPal link above if you would like to show your thanks that way.
